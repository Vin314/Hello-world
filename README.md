The first section of the guitar is called a headstock,
on which you will find tuners and tuning pegs. The tuning pegs 
allow you tune the guitar by tightening or loosening the wires.
The middle, narrow section of the guitar is called the neck. 
The nut is the white strip closest to the headstock. The front
side of the neck is called the fretboard. And the metal wires
on the fretboard are called the frets, which help your fingers
find the right spots.The biggest part of the guitar is called
the body, which has a hole in the middle called the soundhole. On
the body, the bridge, the saddle, and the bridge pins hold the
wires in place.
